# theme-installer
This application helps to install themes and icons on Linux.

The file must be in ".tgz" or ".tar.gz" format, ready to be extracted in the folder "/usr/share/icons" and/or "/usr/share/themes", just like in the manual process.

An example the basic internal structure of .tar.gz file to the icon theme:
- IconFolderName	[folder]
	+ actions 	[folder]
	+ apps 		[folder]
	+ categories 	[folder]
	+ devices 	[folder]
	+ emblems 	[folder]
	+ emotes 	[folder]
	+ mimetypes 	[folder]
	+ places 	[folder]
	+ status 	[folder]
	+ index.theme 	[file  ]
